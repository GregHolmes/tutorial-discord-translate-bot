# Build a Translate Bot for Discord

Discord is a VoIP, instant messaging and digitial distribution platform, allowing people an easy way to talk over voice, video and text among their communities. I am, and have been involved, in Discord communities for some time now, for various purposes such as gaming, development, 3d printing. Something that is similar between all of these communities (other than that they're on Discord and have me in them) is that they're multi-lingual. 

As an example, I've been gaming with a community of people on various survival games such as Ark, Atlas, and recently moved to an MMO called New World. This community have people from all over the world, the UK, Sweden, Spain, the US, Mexico are just some. 

English tended to be the primary language in this community, but a large number didn't know enough English to get by, so I decided to build a translate bot to make their lives easier and let them connect with everyone else a little easier.

The `starter-files` branch is the starting branch for the accompanying tutorial at: [Blog post url here](), while the `main` branch is the completed code for the tutorial.
